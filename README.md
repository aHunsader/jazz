Website to find jazz song you hate most


Simple django website to learn how to use apis. Uses spotify api and spotipy package to work with python. 

Goes through user's top songs and computes "average song" based on attributes from spotify. Then goes through my jazz playlist (created for ethnomusicology class) and finds the song that fits worst with the user's average song.

Bugs to be fixed:
1. had trouble implenting sign in page in same window due to CORS errors. To login to spotify account will open different window.
